 * * Encapsulation
	 Encapsulation in Java is a process of wrapping code and data together under a 
	 single unit. In other words, we can say that it is a process of binding a code and the
	 data that manipulates it under the same unit. It prevents external access to the data
	 
	 It is also known as Data Hiding. To achieve encapsulation in Java âˆ’
     Declare the variables of a class as private.
     Provide public setter and getter methods to modify and view the values of the variables
