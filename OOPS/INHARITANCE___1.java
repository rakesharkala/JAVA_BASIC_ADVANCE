	 * Inheritance in Java
		Inheritance is a mechanism that allows us to extend the definition of a class without
		 making any physical changes to the existing class.
		
		Inheritance creates a new class from an existing class. Any new class that we create
		 from an existing class is called a derived class, and an existing class is called a 
		 base class.
		
		Concept and Types of inheritance
		The inheritance relationship enables a derived class to inherit features from its base
	    class. A derived class can add new features of its own. Therefore rather than creating
	    completely new classes from scratch, we can take advantage of inheritance and reduce 
	    software complexity.
		
		Class: A class is a group of objects which have common properties. 
		It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created.
		
		Sub Class/Child Class: Subclass is a class that inherits the other class.
	    It is also called a derived class, extended class, or child class.
	    
		Super Class/Parent Class: Superclass is the class from where a subclass inherits the
		 features. It is also called a base class or a parent class.
		 
		Reusability: As the name specifies, reusability is a mechanism that facilitates 
		you to reuse the fields and methods of the existing class when you create a new class.
	    You can use the same fields and methods already defined in the previous class.
	    
		Types of inheritance :
		
		Single Inheritance
		Multiple Inheritance
		Hierarchical Inheritance
		Multilevel Inheritance
		Hybrid Inheritance
		java inheritance
		
		1. Single Inheritance 
		It is the inheritance hierarchy wherein one derived class inherits from one base class.
		
		 
		2. Multiple Inheritance 
		It is the inheritance hierarchy wherein one derived class inherits from multiple base 
		classes.
		
		 
		3. Hierarchical  Inheritance 
		It is the inheritance hierarchy wherein multiple derived classes inherit from one base 
		class.
		
		 
		4. Multilevel  Inheritance 
		It is the inheritance hierarchy wherein subclass acts as a base class for other classes.
		
		5. Hybrid  Inheritance 
		It is the inheritance hierarchy that reflects any legal combination of the other four 
		types of inheritance
